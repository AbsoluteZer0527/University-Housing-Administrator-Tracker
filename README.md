# University Housing Administrator Tracker

__Deployed On Vercel: https://university-housing-administrator-tr.vercel.app/__

This is a Next.js program that automatically discovers and tracks contact information for housing administrators at California universities, this is considered my personal project for Unishack. The script uses cheerio + axios web scraping to find staff directories, contact pages, and housing department information, then organizes the data for easy management and outreach.
